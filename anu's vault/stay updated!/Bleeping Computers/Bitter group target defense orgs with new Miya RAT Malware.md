- **Threat Group:** Bitter, active since 2013, focuses on cyberespionage targeting governments and critical organizations in Asia.
- **Recent Activity:** Used MiyaRAT, a new malware, alongside WmRAT to target defense organizations in Turkey.
- **MiyaRAT Details:** Likely reserved for high-value targets and deployed selectively.
- **2022 Campaign:** Exploited a Microsoft Office remote code execution flaw to attack the Bangladeshi government.
- **2023 Campaign:** Impersonated the Kyrgyz Embassy in Beijing to conduct phishing attacks on Chinese nuclear energy companies and academics.
- **Tactics:** Employs evolving techniques to carry out targeted, strategic cyberespionage operations.

## **The WmRAT and MiyaRAT malware

- **Initial Deployment:** Bitter first deployed WmRAT, but upon failure to connect with the command and control (C2) server, it downloaded MiyaRAT (gfxview.msi).
- **Capabilities:** Both WmRAT and MiyaRAT, written in C++, offer data exfiltration, remote control, screenshot capture, command execution (via CMD/PowerShell), and system monitoring.
- **MiyaRAT Features:**
    - Advanced encryption for data and communications.
    - Interactive reverse shell.
    - Enhanced directory and file control.
- **Selective Deployment:** MiyaRAT is reserved for high-value targets, limiting exposure to analysts.
- **Detection Tools:** Proofpoint's report includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and a YARA rule for threat detection.

## **Working of this Malware

The attacks in Turkey started with an email containing a foreign investment project lure, attaching a RAR archive.

The archive contains a decoy PDF file (~tmp.pdf), a shortcut file disguised as a PDF (PUBLIC INVESTMENTS PROJECTS 2025.pdf.lnk), and alternate data streams (ADS) embedded in the RAR fileÂ named "Participation" and "Zone.Identifier."

If the recipient opens the LNK file, they trigger the execution of PowerShell code hidden in the ADS, which opens the legitimate decoy PDF for distraction. At the same time, it creates a scheduled task named "DsSvcCleanup" that runs a malicious curl command every 17 minutes.

The command reaches a staging domain (jacknwoods[.]com) and awaits responses such as commands to download additional payloads, perform network reconnaissance, or steal data.
